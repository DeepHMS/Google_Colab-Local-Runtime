Syntax to Start Colab Local Runtime
To start the Jupyter server in your colab_env environment and connect Google Colab:

$ conda activate colab_env
$ jupyter notebook --NotebookApp.allow_origin='https://colab.research.google.com' --port=8888 --NotebookApp.port_retries=0

Steps:
Run the above commands in your terminal.
Copy the token URL from the terminal output (e.g., http://localhost:8888/?token=your_token_here).
Open Google Colab (https://colab.research.google.com), click “Connect” > “Connect to local runtime,” paste the URL, and click “Connect.”
Verify with !pwd in a Colab cell to confirm it’s accessing your local directory (e.g., /home/biminion/...).
Notes:
If port 8888 is in use, replace it with another (e.g., --port=8892) and update the URL in Colab.
Ensure proxies are unset to avoid SSLEOFError

$ unset http_proxy https_proxy HTTP_PROXY HTTPS_PROXY

Syntax to Stop Colab Local Runtime
To stop the Jupyter server and disconnect Colab:

In the Terminal:
Press Ctrl+C in the terminal where the Jupyter server is running.
Confirm shutdown by typing y if prompted:

Shutdown this notebook server (y/[n])? y

This stops the server and disconnects Colab.
Deactivate the Conda Environment (optional):

$ conda deactivate

Connecting Google Colab with Local Run time
Paste the URL from your terminal into the "Backend URL" field and click "Connect."
